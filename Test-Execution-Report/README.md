# Test Execution Report – Summary

This Test Execution Report documents the end-to-end testing activities performed for a web-based application, covering both Manual Testing and API Testing.

The report is structured in a chapter-wise format to present testing activities in a clear and systematic manner. It includes detailed manual test execution for critical application flows such as login and post-login product functionalities, along with test results, severity and priority analysis, and key observations derived from testing.

In addition to manual testing, this report covers API testing concepts and practical implementation using Postman. It includes API test case design, execution of multiple REST APIs, validation of request and response data, and analysis of API behavior.

Furthermore, the report demonstrates API automation testing using Postman and Newman. Automated test execution steps, command-line execution using Newman, and generation of HTML test reports are included to showcase automation capabilities and reporting skills.

Overall, this report reflects hands-on experience in:
- Manual Functional Testing
- Test Case Design and Execution
- Defect Severity and Priority Analysis
- API Testing using Postman
- API Automation using Newman
- Test Reporting and Documentation

This documentation serves as a testing portfolio to demonstrate practical software testing skills, tools usage, and real-world testing workflow.
